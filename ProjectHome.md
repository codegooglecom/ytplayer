Currently YouTube doesn't offer an option of embedding its videos via https, so if you add a video to a secure page, browsers will display a security warning.

YTPlayer offers a simple way to get around this. The SWF file acts as a proxy between your site and YouTube, and pulls in the video you specify in your HTML code. The result? No security warning!

See the [Implementation](Implementation.md) page for instructions on how to use YTPlayer on your site.
